        <h1>Investing in Bonds</h1>
        <p>Bonds are fixed-income investments where you lend money to a government, municipality,or corporation. In return, they pay periodic interest and return the principal at maturity. Interest payments are predetermined based on the bond's interest rate, expressed as a percentage of the face value. </p>
        <p>Bonds have a fixed term (maturity date), and there are types like government, municipal, and corporate bonds. While lower-risk than stocks, bonds still carry risks related to interest rates and the issuer's financial health. They provide income through interest payments and contribute stability to diversified portfolios.</p>
