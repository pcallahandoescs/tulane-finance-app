        <h1>Going Out</h1>
        <p>It's okay to allocate funds for fun activities, but being responsible about spending is key. While it's essential to enjoy social activities, consider the opportunity cost of every dollar spent, as it could be directed towards savings or other financial goals. Consider cost-effective alternatives for socializing and maintain a balance between enjoying college life and building a foundation for your financial future. Developing responsible financial habits during college sets the stage for long-term financial well-being.</p>
